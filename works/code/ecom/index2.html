						<ul>
							<li>Merchants – eBusinesses and online retailers</li>
							<li>Issuing banks – Customers’ bank card issuers</li>
							<li>Card Associations: Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express</li>
							<li>Acquiring banks (or acquirers) – Banks or financial institutions that process credit and debit card payments for merchant products or services. The term acquirer indicates that the bank accepts or acquires card payment from the card-issuing banks within an association. These institutions are also known as processors, distinguished by their ability to actually process a transaction. Processors must have the technical capability to receive transaction data from a merchant via the internet, then communicate with appropriate financial institutions to approve or decline transactions. Processors must also be able to settle completed transactions through financial institutions in order to deposit funds into the merchant’s bank account.</li>
							<li>Independent Sales Organizations (ISOs) and/or Merchant Service Providers (MSPs) – Companies that resell the products or services of single or multiple processors. These can be gateway companies and/or merchant account providers who develop their own or aggregate other value-added products and services on behalf of the acquirers. Such offerings include billing, reporting, customer service, authorization, and settlement services. These companies are also called online Payment Service Providers (PSP). Typically, a PSP can connect to multiple acquiring banks, card and payment networks. Furthermore, a full-service PSP can offer risk management services, fraud protection and reporting in addition to multi-currency functionality and services.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>To start accepting online payments you need an internet merchant account and a payment gateway.</p>
